# CS577Tests

The test shell is only tested in Ubuntu but should be working on all systems supporting the POSIX standard.

To run the test, enter the following command under this directory.

```sh
$ ./test.sh <homework_number> ./path/to/executable
```

Replace `<homework_number>` with the number of homework.
